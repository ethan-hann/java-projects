# How About a Nice Cup of _Java_?
Welcome to my Java Project Repository!

Here you will find some of my Java projects that I have worked on over the years. These include  
personal projects and school projects. See below for descriptions of projects if you don't want to go through the repository :smile:

_Interested in other projects I've worked on not Java-related?_

public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
