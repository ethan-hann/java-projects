# How About a Nice Cup of _Java_?
```java
public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
Welcome to my Java Project Repository!

Here you will find some of my Java projects that I have worked on over the years. These include personal projects and school projects. See below for descriptions of projects if you don't want to go through the repository :smile:

_Interested in other projects I've worked on not Java-related? Check out my other [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/ethan-hann)._

## School Projects
### Fall 2016
* **CSCI 1471 - ComputerScience2**
  * Area Calculator
  * Car Trip V2
  * Caesar Cipher
  * Grade Level
  * Palindrome Checker

### Spring 2018
* **CSCI 3321 - Numerical Methods**
  * Approximating the Derivative of $f(x)$ using the definition of the derivative _(Assignment 1)_:
     $$
     f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
     $$
  * Approximating a Root of $f(x)$ using Secant Method _(Assignment 2)_:
     $$
     x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})(x_{n} - x_{n-1})}{f(x_{n}) - f(x_{n-1})},
     \text{where } x_{n} \text{and } x_{n-1} \text{are initial guesses for the root}
     $$
  * Approximating a Root of $f(x)$ using Bisection Method and Newton's Method _(InClassAssignment)_:

    **_Newton's Method_**
     $$
     \text{Starting with initial guess } x_{0}: x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \frac{f(x_{n})}{f'(x_{n})}
     $$

* **CSCI 3352 - Advanced Data Structures**
  * Comparison of QuickSort and HeapSort _(Program1-NonGUI)_
